- Basic API functionality
- Simple middleware system
- Basic security features
- Documentation

## Test Results

- Total tests: 321
- Passed: 293
- Skipped: 28
- Failed: 0
- Coverage: 48%

### Skipped Tests
- Tests requiring JWT authentication (to be fixed in future releases)
- Tests requiring API key authentication (to be fixed in future releases)
- Tests requiring async support (to be fixed in future releases)
- Performance integration tests with batch processing (need refactoring for async support)

### Warnings
- PytestConfigWarning: Unknown config option: omit
- RuntimeWarning: coroutine methods not properly awaited in various test classes
- PytestUnhandledCoroutineWarning: async def functions are not natively supported in some test files

### Known Issues
- Authentication: JWT and API key authentication not working properly in tests
- Middleware: Many middleware components not properly handling async functions
- Test Structure: Many test classes have coroutine methods that are not properly awaited
- Batch Processing: Coroutines not properly awaited in batch processing tests
- Async Support: Need to refactor more tests to properly support async functions with pytest-asyncio

### Pending Steps
1. Continue refactoring middleware tests to use AsyncMiddlewareTester:
   - Trusted Types middleware
   - Error handling middleware
   - Cache middleware
   - HSTS middleware
   - Permissions Policy middleware
   - Security Headers middleware
   - SRI middleware
2. Update security tests to use async/await syntax
3. Fix remaining coroutine warnings
4. Improve test coverage for core components
5. Add performance tests for critical paths
