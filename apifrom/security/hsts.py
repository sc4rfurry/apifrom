To submit {domain} to the HSTS preload list:

1. Ensure your domain meets all the requirements:
   - Serves all subdomains over HTTPS
   - Redirects from HTTP to HTTPS
   - Has a valid SSL/TLS certificate
   - Has an HSTS header with:
     - max-age of at least 31536000 seconds (1 year)
     - includeSubDomains directive
     - preload directive

2. Visit https://hstspreload.org/ and enter your domain.

3. Follow the instructions to submit your domain.

4. Wait for your domain to be added to the preload list.
   This can take several months, as it needs to be included in browser releases.

5. Once your domain is in the preload list, browsers will always use HTTPS
   for your domain and all subdomains, even on the first visit.

Note: Be careful when enabling HSTS preloading. Once your domain is in the
preload list, it can be difficult to remove, and all subdomains must support
HTTPS indefinitely.
