  <strong>Transform any Python function into a production-ready REST API endpoint in seconds</strong>
</div>

Welcome to the official documentation for **APIFromAnything**, a powerful Python library designed to transform ordinary Python functions into fully-functional REST API endpoints using a decorator-based approach.

## Version 1.0.0 - Production Ready

APIFromAnything is now production-ready with version 1.0.0! This release includes:

- Comprehensive test suite with high code coverage
- Production-grade security features
- Performance optimizations for high-traffic scenarios
- Detailed documentation and examples
- Support for multiple deployment environments
- Full async/await support throughout the codebase

## Overview

APIFromAnything is designed to be robust, extensible, and high-performance, with features like automatic routing, input validation, output serialization, error handling, and documentation generation. It's perfect for quickly creating APIs from existing code, building microservices, or developing serverless functions.

```python
from apifrom import API, api

app = API(title="My API")

@api(route="/hello/{name}")
def hello(name: str, greeting: str = "Hello") -> dict:
    """Say hello to someone."""
    return {"message": f"{greeting}, {name}!"}

# That's it! You now have a fully functioning API endpoint
```
