# Production Deployment Checklist

This checklist will help you prepare your APIFromAnything application for production deployment.

## Code Cleanup

- [ ] Run the cleanup script to remove unnecessary files:
  ```bash
  python cleanup.py
  ```
- [ ] Remove any development-specific code or comments
- [ ] Ensure all debug flags are set to `False`
- [ ] Remove any hardcoded credentials or sensitive information

## Security

- [ ] Enable HTTPS with proper SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure CORS settings appropriately
- [ ] Set up authentication and authorization
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add request validation

- [ ] Review and update security headers
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection for forms
- [ ] Audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities

## Performance

- [ ] Enable caching where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Configure connection pooling
- [ ] Set appropriate timeouts
- [ ] Configure async workers appropriately
- [ ] Implement pagination for large result sets
- [ ] Optimize payload sizes

## Configuration

- [ ] Use environment variables for configuration

- [ ] Document monitoring and alerting setup

## Testing

- [ ] Run comprehensive tests before deployment
