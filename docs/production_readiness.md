# Production Readiness

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare the APIFromAnything codebase for production deployment.

## Cleanup and Optimization

- Created a `cleanup.py` script to remove unnecessary files:
  - Build artifacts (`build/`, `dist/` directories)
  - Python cache files (`__pycache__` directories, `.pyc` files)
  - Test cache (`.pytest_cache/` directory)
  - Coverage data (`.coverage` file)
  - Package metadata (`*.egg-info/` directories)
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent these files from being committed to version control

## Docker Support

- Added a `Dockerfile` for containerizing the application
- Created a `docker-compose.yml` for orchestrating the application with Redis and Nginx
- Set up Nginx configuration for reverse proxy, SSL termination, and security headers
- Created directory structure for Nginx configuration

## Health Checks

- Implemented a health check module (`apifrom/health.py`) with:
  - Simple health check endpoint
  - Detailed health check with system metrics
  - Database connection check
  - Redis connection check
- Added health check endpoints to the main application
- Added `psutil` dependency for system metrics

## Documentation

- Created a production deployment checklist (`docs/production_checklist.md`)
- Updated the README with sections on:
  - Preparing for production
  - Docker deployment
  - SSL configuration
- Added the production checklist to the documentation table of contents

## Security

- Configured Nginx with security headers:
  - HTTPS redirection
  - Strict Transport Security
  - Content Security Policy
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Referrer Policy
- Set up SSL configuration in Nginx

## Next Steps

The following items should be addressed before deploying to production:

1. Set up proper SSL certificates (replace the placeholders in `nginx/ssl/`)
2. Configure environment-specific settings
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Implement a backup strategy
5. Configure CI/CD pipelines
6. Perform load testing
7. Audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities
